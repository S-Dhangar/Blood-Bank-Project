            Here you can find activities
            to practise your reading skills.
            Reading will help you to improve your
            understanding of the language and build your vocabulary.

            The self-study lessons in this section are
            written and organised according to
            the levels of the Common European Framework
            of Reference for languages (CEFR).
            There are different types of texts and interactive exercises that practise the reading skills you need
            to do
            well in your studies, to get ahead at work and to communicate in English in your free time.

            Take our free online English test to find out which level to choose. Select your level, from beginner
            (CEFR
            level A1) to advanced (CEFR level C1), and improve your reading skills at your own speed, whenever it's
            convenient for you.
